Here's a list of the base operator properties:

Symmetric, densely defined quadratic form  on 

Closed (lower semicontinuous) form

Semibounded / nonnegative form

Markov (Dirichlet form; normal contraction property)

Beurling–Deny pure-jump structure (difference-energy / jump form)

Selfadjoint generator  (Friedrichs/Kato representation)

Sub-Markovian / positivity-preserving semigroup 

Irreducibility (no nontrivial invariant closed ideals)

Positivity improving semigroup (for )

Compact resolvent

Discrete spectrum (pure point; finite multiplicities; only accumulation at )

Existence of ground-state eigenvalue 

Ground state strictly positive a.e.

Ground state eigenvalue simple

Reflection symmetry (commutes with parity operator)

Even/odd invariant subspace decomposition

Ground state even

Spectral gap above ground state (strict inequality )

Variational/min–max characterization of eigenvalues

Rayleigh–Ritz/Galerkin upper bounds; monotone convergence with form-dense subspaces

Stability under bounded perturbations (selfadjointness and compact resolvent preserved)

Finite-rank perturbation determinant/Birman–Schwinger characterization (when applicable)

Whole-line translation-invariant extension with explicit Lévy symbol 

Fourier-multiplier representation on  (Lévy–Khintchine form)

Spectral zeta function and regularized determinant/canonical product (existence)

Ordered by importance for proving even / simple, tagging hard:

Parity symmetry; even/odd block decomposition

Finite-rank pole term; rank-two → two rank-one updates after parity diagonalization

Birman–Schwinger / Weinstein–Aronszajn scalar/determinant characterization

Positivity improving semigroup for the base operator (Perron–Frobenius leverage) hard

Base ground state strictly positive a.e. hard

Base ground state eigenvalue simple hard

Irreducibility (enables positivity improving in the killed setting) hard

Markov/Dirichlet-form property (enables the positive semigroup framework) hard

Compact resolvent (discrete spectrum; needed for PF + eigen-expansions)

Resolvent domination/comparison (killed interval vs whole-line)

Whole-line translation-invariant extension with explicit symbol 

Archimedean log-growth coercivity bound for 

Variational/min–max principle

Rayleigh–Ritz/Galerkin monotone upper bounds (parity-separated)

Stability of compact resolvent under bounded perturbations
